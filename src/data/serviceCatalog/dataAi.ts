      { q: "Do we need new hardware?", a: "Not always. Many machines already have sensors or controllers we can read from. Where they don't, we recommend add-on sensors or gateways that fit your setup." },
      { q: "What happens if the connection drops?", a: "Edge devices keep collecting and processing data locally, then sync with the cloud when the connection returns." },
      { q: "How do you keep connected devices secure?", a: "Each device gets its own identity, all traffic is encrypted, and updates are signed and controlled. We also separate device networks from the rest of your systems." },
      { q: "How quickly can we see results?", a: "A focused pilot on a few devices can show live data within weeks. We then scale in phases based on what the pilot proves." },
