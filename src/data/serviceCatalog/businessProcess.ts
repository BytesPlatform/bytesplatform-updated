      { q: "How is RPO different from a staffing agency?", a: "An agency usually fills individual roles. RPO takes over part or all of your recruiting process, working as an extension of your team under your brand and in your systems." },
      { q: "Will candidates know they're working with an outside partner?", a: "That's up to you. Most clients have us recruit under their brand, using their email and careers pages." },
      { q: "Do you use AI to make hiring decisions?", a: "No. AI helps with screening, matching and scheduling, but recruiters review the results and your managers make every hiring decision." },
      { q: "Can you hire for technical roles?", a: "Yes. As a technology company, we're well placed to source and screen engineers, designers and data specialists, as well as non-technical roles." },
